# PART 1. HYPERVISORS
### 1.What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?
I think the most popular hypervisors for virtualization are Hyper-V and VMware.

### 2.Briefly describe the main differences of the most popular hypervisors.
The most expensive solution today is VMware, Hyper-V is cheaper.
When calculating the cost of a virtualization system, in addition to the hypervisor itself, you need to take into account the cost of software licenses installed on virtual machines. From this vantage point, Hyper-V will provide additional savings over VMware.
In hyper-converged solutions, Hyper-V is significantly cheaper.
The VMware solution implements a fault tolerance mechanism, while the Microsoft solution does not yet.
VMware has a better VDI implementation, but Hyper-V is cheaper to set up VDI.
The Hyper-V solution is less demanding on the hardware side.
In the case of using Hyper-V, the organization of storage will cost less than VMware.
VMware has dedicated tools for balancing loads across host resources; Hyper-V does not.
With System Center Virtual Machine Manager in Hyper-V, you can create private clouds as well as simple server virtualization projects.
